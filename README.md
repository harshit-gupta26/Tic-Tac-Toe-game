## About

Tic-Tac-Toe Game is a simple browser-based implementation of the classic 3×3 grid game, using vanilla web technologies.  
It supports **two-player mode (local multiplayer)** on the same device, allowing players to alternate turns placing **X** and **O**.  
The game detects wins, draws, and allows you to restart.

- Two-player (local) mode — play on the same device  
- Real-time game state updates

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You only need a modern web browser. No additional server or build tools are required.

---

## Usage
Open the TIc-Tac-Toe.html file in your browser (double-click or open via browser).

The game interface will load.

Players take turns clicking on empty cells to place their marks (X or O).

The game will announce a winner or a draw.

Click the Reset or Restart button to start a new game.

---

## How It Works

(1). The game board is a 3×3 grid (9 cells).

(2). Players alternate placing their marks (X or O) by clicking on empty cells.

(3). After each move, the game logic checks for:

A winning line (row, column, or diagonal), or

A draw (if all cells are filled and no winner).

(4). If a win or draw is detected, the game stops accepting moves and shows the result.

(5). The player can reset to play again.

The core logic resides in a JavaScript file (e.g. script.js) which manages the game state, turn switching, checking win conditions, and UI updates.

## Technologies Used

**HTML5** — structure & layout

**CSS3** — styling & responsive layout

**JavaScript (ES6+**) — game logic & interactivity

---

## Future Enhancements

Here are some ideas to expand or improve the project:

Add an **AI / single-player mode** (play vs computer)

Add a **scoreboard**  to track wins across multiple rounds

Add **animations**  and transitions

Make it **responsive / mobile-friendly** 

Add **themes or color choices** 

Add **sound effects / music** 

Deploy it online (GitHub Pages or another hosting)
